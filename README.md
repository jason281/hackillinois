#Abstract
  Automatic Face Recognition is often regarded as a computer version tecnique that requires high computing power. We aim to provide a prototype of automatic Face Recognition on Rpi 3 featuring in real-time application. In current version, we have adapt Viola Jonse' Face Detection and PCA Face Recognition with QT Framework.
